# User Story Artefact Management

1. **Upload digital artefact** – As a knowledge worker, I can upload a file (PDF or image) so it can be referenced later.
2. **Register a physical book** – As a researcher, I create an artefact record for a book by entering its title and metadata.
3. **Attach artefacts to a note** – As a note taker, I select existing artefacts and link them to a note.
4. **Browse artefacts** – As a user, I list and search artefacts to discover stored resources.
5. **View artefacts for a note** – As a reader, I open a note and see referenced artefacts with links or bibliographic data.
